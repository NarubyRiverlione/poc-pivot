# TODO

- use react hook useId instead of index in dataTable getRowId ?

- use React Query instead of manually resource cache ? Is this compatible with Xrm.webApi ?

## Feature: edibility

Make the data in the table editable.

- useOptimistic during the update to have a immediately UX with potential fail-back
